ksalgo - Karplus-Strong Algorithm C Library
============================================

ksalgo is a lightweight C library that implements the Karplus-Strong algorithm for generating plucked string sounds.

Getting Started:
----------------
1. Clone or download the ksalgo repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the ksalgo library using the provided Makefile by running `make` in the ksalgo directory.
3. Include the `ksalgo.h` header file in your C project and link against the `libksalgo.a` library.

API Overview:
-------------
The ksalgo library provides the following functions and structures:

- KsalgoNote structure: Represents a single note generated by the Karplus-Strong algorithm
- ksalgo_init_note(): Initializes a KsalgoNote structure
- ksalgo_start_note(): Starts playing a note with the specified frequency and decay
- ksalgo_stop_note(): Stops playing a note
- ksalgo_free_note(): Frees resources associated with a note
- ksalgo_process_note(): Generates the next audio sample for a note
- ksalgo_mix_audio(): Mixes the audio output from multiple notes into a single buffer

For more details on the usage of these functions, refer to the `ksalgo.h` header file.
